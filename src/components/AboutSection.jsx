            I specialize in Node.js, utilizing Express for backend APIs and React for frontend UI.PostgreSQL and MongoDB are my go-to SQL and NoSQL databases, but I&apos;m open to exploring others as well. Iâ€™m always keen on learning new technologies and falling in love with the process of mastering them.

          <div>
            When I&apos;m not coding, I love surfing YouTube, always looking for content on gaming, PC building, and system customization. I also enjoy solving Rubik&apos;s cubes and sometimes tackling Sudoku.
